The Team
========

Black Label Solutions is a new business venture that has world class technology in the mobile POS space. It has several huge customers in Australia and is on the verge of launching their consumer facing product in the iTunes (and eventually Android) app store to give anyone the ability to take mobile payments easily and securely.

Black Label Solutions is a small but tight team. The front-end development team consists of a handful of Web, Android and iOS developers based in both Australia and the Philippines.

Australian Team
---------------

Business strategy, product development, project management and back-end development is currently exclusively done out of the Australian office based in Melbourne. It also has the leads for Web, iOS and Android development.

Philippines Team
----------------

The Philippines team perform systems administration, automated and manual testing, Android and somewhat less iOS and Web Development.

Communicating
-------------

Skype seems to be the most common chat client.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is currently scattered across docs on people's computers, Sharepoint, Confluence, the Shared network drive, the Philippines Intranet, this microsite and sticky notes. Pretty standard for any startup :)

This is a known issue though and Management are keen to develop a documentation strategy to make it easy for everyone to share and find the information they need quickly and easily. If you have any thoughts around documentation strategies or know of good tools or processes, please let us know.

Great documentation is a vital tool in scaling a workforce in a controlled and quality way and your contribution to documentation and other forms of knowledge sharing are just as important as the code your write.
