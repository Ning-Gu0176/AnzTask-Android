.. rubric:: API documnetation for the core, projects and third party libraries and frameworks.

.. note:: To ensure you're looking at the most current version of the API docs (or if they docs don't yet exist), open terminal, cd into the project root and run `make apidocs`

Three sets of API docs are produced as part of the ``apidocs`` make task:

 - `Core API docs <../_static/core_api_docs/html/index.html>`_
 - `Application API docs <../_static/app_api_docs/html/index.html>`_
 - `Third party API docs <../_static/third_party_api_docs/html/index.html>`_
