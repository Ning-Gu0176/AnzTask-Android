Third Party Libraries
=====================

View the contents of the ``required/third_party`` directory to view the current third party libraries in use.

.. warning:: Many of these are either outdated (potentially all), not required (JSON) or can be replaced by better newer libraries (ASIHTTPRequest with AFNetworking).

A review of these third party libraries is essential, as well as defining a plan for how third party libraries will be consumed (e.g. CocoaPods).
