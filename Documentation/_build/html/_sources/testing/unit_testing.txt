Android Studio Unit Test
========================

Android Studio provides with very convenient way for unit test. If you don’t know how to set up unit test in Android Studio, :doc:`How to set up unit test <howto/unit_test_set_up>` will help you to get start.

AnzVolley Test Case
===================

The main functionality of AnzVolley is making RESTful request and parsing response JSON object, so unit test should include testing all different RESTful requests.Since AnzVoley makes asynchronous request, a limited time out loop should be used for testing. Further more, any unit functionality should have separated test case as well.

.. warning:: internet permission must be added into AnzVolley module’s AndroidManifest file since the test involves networking. Otherwise the test case will definitely fail.

AnzVolley test cases include:

 - testEarthquakeData (test the RESTful request of earthquake data)
 - testBuildingNamePairsWithoutProperty (test the name pairs building logic)
 - testBuildingNamePairsWithProperty (test the name pairs building logic)

.. note:: 

 - Test case name might be different from above. refer to project/AnzVolley/src/androidTest for the test source code.
 - To test private method of AnzVolley, reflection can be used. If test team has access to the source code, just change private method to public method.
