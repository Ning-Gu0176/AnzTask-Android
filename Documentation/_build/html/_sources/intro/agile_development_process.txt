Agile Development process
=========================

Black Label Solutions embraces the Agile philosophy and uses the Scrum implementation.

Be sure to talk to your manager about the specifics around how sprints are run and what your requirements are regarding Jira, the working agreement and the definition of done. They are not recorded here as they are updated regularly. Ask your product owner for a copy of these documents as its vital that when you report something as "done" in a standup, it is compliant with the Black Label Solutions version of done.

.. TODO: Include links to the working agreement, and definition of done here. They should be in Confluence, Sharepoint or somewhere publicly accessible

We do our best to have a brilliant agile process but if you notice something that could be improved or want to contribute something that worked well in your previous role, please let us know.
